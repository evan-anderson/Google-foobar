# Google Foobar Challenges
In the last year, I've become interested in imporving my Python chops. When I found out about the Google Foobar Challenges, I thought I'd give them a try for fun! Included in this repository are the problems I found on [Neeraj Aggarwal's Github](https://github.com/n3a9/google-foobar) along with the solutions I came up with. 

Although the real challenge required solutions using Python 2.7, I decided to use Python 3.6.
